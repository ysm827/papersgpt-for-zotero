## Industrial-Scale Multi-Document Intelligence for Zotero. 100% Local. Zero Hallucinations.

**PapersGPT** is a professional-grade Zotero extension engineered in Native C++ to transform thousands of isolated PDFs into a single, high-precision knowledge engine. While standard tools struggle with single-file chat or slow, "fuzzy" embeddings, PapersGPT delivers instant, cross-document synthesis and global library search with absolute data sovereignty.

## ⚡ Extreme Performance: Built for "Big Data" Researchers

Stop waiting for embedding progress bars. Most AI tools use Python/JS scripts that lag or crash as your library grows. **PapersGPT’s C++ core provides:**

- **Benchmark**: On a Mac with an Intel i9, indexing 1,506 documents occupying 4.5GB of disk space took 141 seconds, while the PapersGPT agent process consumed 227MB of memory, with an average retrieval time of 15ms.
- **Near-Instant Indexing**: Process 10,000+ documents in minutes, not hours.
- **Hardware Efficiency**: Millisecond-level retrieval with minimal RAM usage, leaving your system resources free for other tasks.
- **Zero-Cloud Dependency**: High-speed structural indexing occurs 100% on your machine. No external APIs, no cloud bottlenecks, even works in Airplane Mode.

## 🎯 Superior Multi-Doc Intelligence & Accuracy

PapersGPT moves beyond the "fuzzy" matching of standard semantic search by embeddings. Our engine understands document structure, ensuring that cross-paper comparisons are logically sound and factually accurate.

- **Deep Cross-Document Comparison**  
  *“Compare the sample sizes and p-values of all 50 clinical trials in my 'Cardiology' folder.”*  
  AI synthesizes data from multiple files into structured tables or reports without losing the nuances of individual studies.

- **Global Library Synthesis**  
  Ask questions across your entire Zotero library. Identify trends, evolution of terms, or conflicting evidence across 10,000+ documents simultaneously.

- **Verifiable Evidence (Click-to-Jump)**  
  Accuracy is useless without proof. Every synthesis includes interactive citations. Every AI response includes precise citations; clicking on them takes you directly to the specific paper being cited.

- **Ensure the absolute 100% privacy and security of your local sensitive Zotero data**

- **Support 100% offline local LLMs**  
  PapersGPT currently supports three different ways to connect to local large language models (LLMs):

  1. **Integrated SOTA open-source LLMs** – such as Gemma 4 12B and Qwen3.5 4B. These models can be downloaded and run with a single click, eliminating the need for complex installation procedures; simply selecting a model from the "Local LLM" option triggers an automatic download from Hugging Face and launches the model.

  2. **Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint** – connect to a flexible OpenAI-compatible privately deployed LLM endpoint by configuring a customized LLM API within PapersGPT.

  3. **Ollama integration** – supports connections to local Ollama instances; any LLM deployed and running locally via Ollama can be connected and used simply by configuring it within PapersGPT.

- **Parsing, Indexing and Searching** documents in Zotero are performed locally, there is no reliance on the clouds, and these operations can be run offline.

- **Local LLMs and local document processing** ensure **"zero-byte" data leakage** from your device.
